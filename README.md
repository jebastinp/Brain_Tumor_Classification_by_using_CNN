# Brain_Tumor_Classification_by_using_CNN
This project is to develop a robust brain tumor classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust brain tumor classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify MRI images of the human brain into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No tumor, and Pituitary. By using deep learning techniques, the classifier aims to assist medical professionals in efficiently diagnosing brain tumors, thereby improving patient outcomes through early detection and treatment planning.

# Algorithm
The algorithm using this project is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm serves as the backbone for our brain tumor classifier, using its prowess in image classification tasks. CNNs excel in detecting patterns and features within images, making them ideal for analysing MRI scans. Through a series of convolutional layers, the CNN extracts increasingly abstract representations of the input images, capturing intricate details crucial for tumor classification. Pooling layers then condense these representations while retaining essential information. Additionally, fully connected layers further refine these features, ultimately producing predictions across the four tumor categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or identifying the absence of a tumor. By harnessing the power of CNNs, our model can accurately discern the presence and type of brain tumors, aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment.
